*A word from Kaptin Barrett :* 

<br>

Over the first lockdown I was putting out a playlist a day covering everything from New Orleans Jazz to Icelandic Rap music so I'm really surprised that I never made one fusing my first two true loves, Hip-hop and Reggae. Ever since I first heard Asher D & Daddy Freddy's 'Raggamuffin Hip-hop Album' in the late 80s, I've loved the fusion of the two and I feel that it's a sound that never gets old to me so I've put together a bunch off my favourites from the 90s right through to now, including lots of artists I've booked at Boomtown over the years and many I'm grateful to call friends. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it.
