Absolute madness a gwaan !

A word from Daniel :

**Shaolin Sound - Killer 80s**

"Here is a killer selection of exciting and interesting 80s Rubadub from the era that started fusing digi synth sounds with live instrumentation! The beginning of the evolution of Reggae music into what King Jammys took the limelight..."
