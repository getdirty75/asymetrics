### **Matteo Fava**

Matteo Fava began his musical career at the young age of 18, playing Reggae music in Bars and small parties in Rome, Italy. Within a few years together with his crew 'Mash Up Babylon' he began to organize parties becoming an active part of the Roman nightlife. Together with his crew they come up with a concept of mixing the sound of Reggae and Jungle music from the UK. Many famous international artists were booked for 'Mash Up Babylon' parties including Youthman Promotion and Congo Natty. In 2012 Matteo moved to Amsterdam where he focused on building his career as a Reggae Dj, spinning records in central bars such as HillStreet Blues and underground parties at the historical club Paradiso. In 2014 Matteo started working at Vintage Voudou tropical record store, a must visit place for all tropical music diggers and DJs. Thanks to his experience at the Vintage Voudou store and its frequent shows at the Red Light Radio, Matteo learned more about Caribbean, African and Latin music and gradually began to include it in his sets. Since 2019 Matteo has been working on his own as a rare record dealer, he travels around the world to find great music from the past decades. He enjoys collecting stories from old time DJs and learning more about tropical music from the 50s to the 90s. He builds up his selections around Caribbean music, Funk and Reggae music.
