### ***Earl Gateshead Presents… Hopeful Village***

*To say we need more love in this world is quite an understatement these days !*

*In this regard, we are trying to do our best by sharing some good vibes with you...*

*Here is **« Hopeful Village »,** 1 hour of true musical love by one of Great Britain’s finest selectors : the legendary [Earl Gateshead](https://trojanrecords.com/earl-gateshead/) !*

*When we wrote to Earl last year to request a mix we didn’t know if he would think much of our humble website…*

*To our surprise he said OK, and a few weeks later he dropped this amazing selection of original jamaican records in our inbox !*

*After a moment of happy dance due to receiving material from a worldwide renowned veteran selector, we listened to the audio file & had to do more happy dancing because it was pure fire coming out of the speakers !*

*Earl is a serious selector, no doubt, he even shared a few words of wisdom on the mic in between those wicked tunes, talking about the importance of asymmetry & the people who don’t fit in the mainstream society!*
