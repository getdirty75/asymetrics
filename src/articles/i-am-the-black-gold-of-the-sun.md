This song has travelled through time to make you groove... it was first released in 1971 on the "Hey Love" EP by [Rotary Connection, ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Connection)a wicked yet obscure band labeled as psychedelic soul, & features the queen[ Minnie Ripperton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnie_Riperton) on vocals...  <br>

### The Rotary Connection

1971 Original Version

This experimental band was founded in Chicago in 1966 by Marshall Chess, son of [the Chess Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_Records) label founder, Leonard Chess & was composed of [Charles Stepney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stepney), a [vibraphonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibraphonist) and classically trained [arranger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arranger "Arranger") and [producer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer "Record producer"), ​Bobby Simms, [Mitch Aliotta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Aliotta "Mitch Aliotta"), Ken Venegas. [Sidney Barnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sidney_Alexander_Barnes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sidney Alexander Barnes (page does not exist)"), Judy Hauff, [Phil Upchurch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Upchurch "Phil Upchurch") and drummer [Morris Jennings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Jennings "Morris Jennings"). Their song "I Am The Black Gold Of The Sun" was to be later profusely covered & sampled by many different artists.

### NuYorican Soul

1997 Cover

One of the best covers to be made, in my humble opinion, of "I Am The Black Gold Of The Sun", and maybe one of the most famous ones, is the 1997 version by Nuyorican Soul aka Little Louie Vega & Kenny Dope Gonzalez ([Masters At Work)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_at_Work) ​featuring [Jocelyn Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocelyn_Brown) on vocals.

The same year, in 1997, definitely a good year for music in many aspects, [the british electronic collective 4 Hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4hero), featuring the jack of many trades Marc Mac, remixed the Nuyorican Soul cover, taking it even further towards perfection, adding a few smooth jungle breaks...it was released on Giles Peterson ["Talkin' Loud" label](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkin%27_Loud), and to this day still remains a beautiful gem of a track !
