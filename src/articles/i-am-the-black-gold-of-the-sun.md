<br>
One of the best covers to be made, in my humble opinion, is the 1997 version by Nuyorican Soul aka Little Louie Vega & Kenny Dope Gonzalez ([Masters At Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_at_Work) ​featuring [Jocelyn Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocelyn_Brown) on vocals.

The same year, in 1997, definitely a good year for music in many aspects, [the british electronic collective 4 Hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4hero), featuring the jack of many trades Marc Mac, remixed the Nuyorican Soul cover, taking it even further towards perfection, adding a few smooth jungle breaks,<br>
<br> 
it was released on Giles Peterson ["Talkin' Loud" label](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkin%27_Loud), beautiful gem of a track !   ![](/img/black-gold-5.jpg)
