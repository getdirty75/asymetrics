This experimental band was founded in Chicago in 1966 by Marshall Chess, son of [the Chess Records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_Records) label founder, Leonard Chess & was composed of [Charles Stepney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Stepney), a [vibraphonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibraphonist) and classically trained [arranger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arranger "Arranger") and [producer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_producer "Record producer"), ​Bobby Simms, [Mitch Aliotta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitch_Aliotta "Mitch Aliotta"), Ken Venegas. [Sidney Barnes](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sidney_Alexander_Barnes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sidney Alexander Barnes (page does not exist)"), Judy Hauff, [Phil Upchurch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Upchurch "Phil Upchurch") and drummer[Morris Jennings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Jennings "Morris Jennings").

their song "I Am The Black Gold Of The Sun" was to be later profusely covered & sampled by many different artists.

One of the best covers to be made, in my humble opinion, is the 1997 version by Nuyorican Soul aka Little Louie Vega & Kenny Dope Gonzalez ([Masters At Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_at_Work) ​featuring [Jocelyn Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jocelyn_Brown) on vocals.

The same year, in 1997, definitely a good year for music in many aspects, [the british electronic collective 4 Hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4hero), featuring the jack of many trades Marc Mac, remixed the Nuyorican Soul cover, taking it even further towards perfection, adding a few smooth jungle breaks, it was released on Giles Peterson ["Talkin' Loud" label](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talkin%27_Loud), beautiful gem of a track !
