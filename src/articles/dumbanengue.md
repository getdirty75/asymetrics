###### You know something crazy is cooking when dj [Fresh Nunas](https://www.mixcloud.com/deadfresh/) is behind it! 

Coming to the help of fellow countryman & multi-talented artist **[Ricardo Pinto Jorge](https://www.instagram.com/ricardopintojorge/),** The Brussels-based dj and Maputo artist used their network spannig everywhere between Bangui and Panama, via Niamey and Havana, to launch a weekly online artistic market, dubbed [Dumbanengue](https://www.facebook.com/operacao.producao.7) after the informal markets than span around Mozambique; and with Spanglish, Portuñol, and Franglais as official languages, the event sounded like something I could not miss.

Since its inception, the market saw exciting things like New York don dada [Nickodemus](https://soundcloud.com/nickodemusnyc) rocking a hyper diverse crowd, with people sipping champagne in a pool somewhere in Europe while a dreadman was lighting up on an African rooftop, Mozambican painters displaying their art via sharescreen, lauded by Panamanian djs and curious Rwandans and Cubans; R&B newcomer [Tayra](https://soundcloud.com/tayra-alline) spoke about her chemical engineering studies, and contemporary Nigerian musician [Ade Bantu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad%C3%A9_Bantu) told anecdotes of working with [Fela Kuti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fela_Kuti) & [Tony Allen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Allen_(musician)).

All of this, and much more, take place in a semi-organized chaos, and although open-access, it feels intimate and confidential enough that random participants can pitch their own thing, or grab the attention to discuss this and that (“bater papo” as they would say in Maputo), giving it a fantastic organic feel.

Dumbanengue was born out of necessity during the Covid-19 crisis, when Ricardo and Nunas thought of a few friends across Africa and Latin America stuck inside, without an income or indeed a platform to share their artistry. It has definitely opened new gates for collaborations and fresh friendships, let’s hope this lasts in the “World after”.

Tune in on Sundays through **Zoom ID: 586-183-2220** – 3pm Central Africa time until however late the audience feels like staying!
