Daniel is a real hyperactive artist who's been involved on the Reggae scene (but not just) for quite a while ! Here are some of his ongoing projects:

**[Shaolin Sound](https://soundcloud.com/shaolin_sound)**  functions as a platform to share discoveries on vinyl from the 70s, 80s & 90s. Focusing on Roots, Rubadub & Digital. More recently releasing limited polyvinyls and soon full vinyl releases with great vocalist and producers, as well as self produced tracks. 

[JUST-IS Records](https://soundcloud.com/justisrecords) & the [Chief Rockas](https://soundcloud.com/chiefrockascollective) collective are inspired by the modern sounds of Reggae. Fusing new sounds with classic elements of Roots, Rubadub & Digi. JUST-IS originally started as a series of events inDaniel's hometown, Norwich, in East of England. **Just-Is** eventually became a platform to release music. 

**Chief Rockas** was created at the same time as the label with Tom Excell, a great producer. He is in the bands [Nubiyan Twist](https://www.nubiyantwist.co.uk/) & [Onipa](https://onipa.bandcamp.com/), and is soon launching his own label.

**[Vision](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9PENiakdMA)** is a new project focused on Daniel's love of **Boom Bap** style Hip Hop, producing beats from old and interesting Soul, Jazz, Soundtrack and anything with interesting sounds for sampling! An EP is coming soon with a young rapper out of Canada called [Kataem](https://soundcloud.com/kataem-oconnor).

**The Grampians** is a band currently functioning as a studio and session band, making a lot of their own riddims, as well as recreating classics, with a couple of tracks out recently with Joe Yorke and Delton Screechie as polyvinyl releases. The Grampians record at drummer **Mikey Shaw**'s studio called **Dub Cavern,** equipped with a collection of brilliant original studio gear like the Roland Space Echo, Grampian Spring Reverb and tons of others to get that authentic 70s and 80s sound. Expect to hear a lot from them in the near future !
