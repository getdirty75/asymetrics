### A Word from Andi:

![](/img/andi-from-the-leipzig-tribe-of-peace-picture-by-www-amirweiss-com.jpg)

<br>

**When I put together this new mixtape.**.. 

I thought of the friends I usually dance with, thought of the people who usually dance at parties and festivals.... come together as different as they are in detail...they are united by many other things... i chose several songs, new and older ones... and went with them via mp3 player and headphones on a hike in the sun on a meadow and in the forest, to a lake... always dancing while walking, with a big grin on my face... singing along and thinking of the others... about friends, strangers.... dancing people... i also thought of those who are not feeling well right now... who are sick, lonely, poor, on the run, in trouble... May their life get better... maybe with all our help, doing, thinking... I was thinking about yesterday... of the past years... of celebrating together, of the now, of being separated... and felt NO! We are not separated... and we will not let ourselves be separated! We belong together for peace, and in love. While I was dancing alone on the meadow, I thought about the others... how they could dance too... on a meadow, at home, somewhere... Dancing.... with joy and laughter on my face, releasing tension, anger, fears. freak out! Yeah! I thought about tomorrow, about the next months... the next summer.... in anticipation of dancing together again... on a meadow, in the sand, at a festival... How we will embrace each other... How we will come together again - without restrictions, without borders, for and in a world without borders! May it be so! A whoopee for life! Whoophooey!
