### **Story of an unproductive yet pleasurable, soulful afternoon!**

After listening to Children of Zeus’ phenomenal [NTS radio shows](https://www.nts.live/shows/children-of-zeus), trying to find which would be the best one I could feature on this humble website (impossible task, they’re all amazing), I thought I’d just select my favorite track of theirs:

<iframe width="100%" height="380" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mMqmC0mLwy4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<br />

<br>

<br>

But then I came across **THIS bad boy**:

The intro bassline sounded so familiar that, intrigued, I dug up where the sample came from and went listening back to the original tune, “Rockin' you Eternally” by Leon Ware, from his 1981 namesake album (youtube link upstairs).

<br>

I found out that the song had been honored by several brilliant samples and covers, with this beauty, by the relatively little known, yet jamming with Roy Ayers, Acid Jazz formation [3d](https://www.challengerecords.com/products/1182852245) being the pinnacle:

<br>

<br>

<br>

While looking him up, I also discovered that Ware was a shadow force behind many 70’s soul & funk spearheads (check [this fantastic and thoroughly researched article on Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1450-9-songs-showcasing-leon-wares-incomparable-soul-touch/) for more history), among whom are none other than Quincy Jones (with the steamy [Body Heat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYuA_c_6if8)) and The Jackson 5 (with the classic [I Wanna Be Where You Are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GLaODfMqn4&feature=emb_logo)); but most importantly for me, he was behind this gem of a soul track by the too-early gone [Minnie Ripperton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minnie_Riperton) (also discussed in [THIS](https://theasymetrics.com/i-am-the-black-gold-of-the-sun/) Asymetrics article):

This gorgeous, kinky & erotic soul anthem, one of my all time favorites, brought back memories of more recent remarkable soul and hip-hop tracks that sampled it:

[J Cole's Everybody Dies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5slZHLSnow&index=4&list=PLQHeeXKilruWRmWkz8z5FMwOT0AUlZqZC&t=0s&app=desktop) immediately came to mind, and while the hip-hop titan needs little introduction, I thought I'd mention New Zealand's [Electric Wire Hustle](https://electricwirehustle.bandcamp.com/), whose warm cutting-edge soul has been rocking my moody mornings since their first [self-titled album](https://www.discogs.com/Electric-Wire-Hustle-Electric-Wire-Hustle/master/431146) and its electrifying track [Chaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7fairoRA48), also featuring this sensual take on the sample:

<br>

<br>

Both amazing tunes, using Minnie’s voice as an instrument, ominous yet smooth and integrating every beat like an unstoppable note…

<br>

Honorable mention also goes to this more recent banger by King Most - See if you can spot Minnie’s voice in the midst of mountains like De La Soul, James Brown, or Fela Kuti!

**After this melodic trip**, I realized that I still hadn't find out why the eternally rocking bassline sounded so familiar, and I had to dig up my old school jungle-head white label vinyls from the early 2000s to nail it: it was THIS obscure, promo-only record that first familiarized me with Ware's legendary anthem:

This classic (if a bit off the beaten path) jungle ruffage also features the head-ringing “The Champ” sample, popularized among the underground youth through KRS 1’s legendary “Rapture”.
