After listening to Children of Zeus’ phenomenal [NTS radio shows](https://www.nts.live/shows/children-of-zeus), trying to find which would be the best one I could feature on this humble website (impossible task, they’re all amazing), I thought I’d just select my favorite tracks of theirs:

But then I came across THIS bad boy:

The intro bassline sounded so familiar that, intrigued, I went listening back to the original tune, “Rocking you Eternally” by Leon Ware, from his 1981 namesake album.



I found out that the song had been honored by several brilliant samples and covers, this beauty being the pinnacle:

While looking him up, I also found out that Ware was a shadow force behind many 70’s soul & funk spearheads (check [this fantastic and thoroughly researched article on Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1450-9-songs-showcasing-leon-wares-incomparable-soul-touch/) for more history), among whom are none other than Quincy Jones (with the kinky [Body Heat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYuA_c_6if8)) and Michael Jackson (with the classic [I Wanna Be Where You Are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GLaODfMqn4&feature=emb_logo)); but most importantly for me, he was behind this gem of a soul track by the too-early gone Minnie Ripperton (also discussed in [THIS](https://theasymetrics.com/i-am-the-black-gold-of-the-sun/) Asymetrics article):

This gorgeous, kinky & erotic soul anthem, one of my all time favorites, brought back memories of more recent remarkable soul and hip-hop tracks that sampled it:
