<br>

**Born in Coventry**, West Midlands in July 1995, Skatta is a special kind of artist, with a passion for his art form and a distinctive sound that sets him apart.

The emcee (real name Nathan Hunter) has already achieved more than most at his age, and despite coming from a city that's not exactly deep in musical history Skatta is changing that on a daily basis. Having collaborated with both American and British singers, rappers and producers, Skatta is laying down tracks for a new generation... and the music industry is listening up.

In 2016, Skatta was requested as a [guest on **BBC 1xtra**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lb62R504AU4&t=135s), and host Sian Anderson's described him as *"one of my favourites to ever do it"*, describing his voice as "*captivating*".

SInce then, Skatta has released an [impressive number of EPs](https://skattacoventry.bandcamp.com/music), has featured regularly on[ Pyro radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N195nkNzDro), and appeared in too many music videos to list ! His first LP, **[Hardships](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwjV-e4nQ2s)**, dropped in July 2020, and features the already classic **[King Kong](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stHE1UBhM-A),** and the below clipped killer choon **Homage** featuring his partner in crime [Kriptik](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8HrmsNqwfWx4JIiAjO3ySg):

With another LP freshly recorded in Paris in the pipeline, a collab with our friend [Dipiz](https://theasymetrics.com/blog/asymetrics-mixtape-4-dipiz/), from the ever cutting-edge [Broc Records](http://www.brocrecordz.com/), expect to hear a lot from Skatta in the near future !
