### **The Asymetrics'[ first playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6rHW23BaddZT6TIlz1sFjx?si=EJiOJ8HAR_yFTMYckrRZCQ) on Spotify comes courtesy of legendary UK festival[ Boomtown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomtown_(music_festival))'s head of music: AAA Badboy, aka[ Kaptin Barrett](https://www.kaptinbarrett.com/).**

*Over the first lockdown I was putting out a playlist a day, covering everything from New Orleans Jazz to Icelandic Rap music so I'm really surprised that I never made one fusing my first two true loves, Hip-hop and Reggae.*

*Ever since I first heard Asher D & Daddy Freddy's 'Raggamuffin Hip-hop Album' in the late 80s, I've loved the fusion of the two and I feel that it's a sound that never gets old to me so I've put together a bunch off my favourites from the 90s right through to now, including lots of artists I've booked at Boomtown over the years and many I'm grateful to call friends. I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed making it.*
