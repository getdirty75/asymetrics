##### Every month, our Bass Music specialist DJ Pohy shares his favorite picks with us.

Hailing from Lille, France, and currently based in Paris, [Pohy](www.facebook.com/DjPohy) has been operating on the Drum&Bass and Dubstep scenes for over a decade.

Together with partner in crime [DJ Bluntsman](https://soundcloud.com/dj-bluntsman), Pohy co-hosts the [One More Tune](https://rinse.fr/artists/one-more-tune/) radio show on Rinse France, as well as another quality *rendez-vous* : the [Safe Travel](https://www.radiocampusparis.org/emission/safe-travel/) show on Radio Campus.
