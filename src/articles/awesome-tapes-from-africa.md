### <https://www.awesometapes.com/>

#### **What can we say? This website is a pure treasure trove**. 

Started as a fun idea to digitize and upload forgotten tapes found during his African trips, [Brian Shimkovitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awesome_Tapes_From_Africa) eventually turned the adventure into a proper Record label featuring amazing artists such as Ethiopia's [Hailu Mergia](https://hailumergia.bandcamp.com/) and the [Dur Dur Band ](https://dur-durband.bandcamp.com/)of Somalia.

Although some of the tapes are now being re-edited as full-on credited albums with sales being shared with the artists, a vast majority of the entries on the website are free downloads of seriously hard to find glorious tapes from all over the continent. 

You've been tipped ! A word of warning though: once you start exploring Awesome Tapes, you will get absorbed into an endless kaleidoscope.
