### Just as [Taiwan MC](https://theasymetrics.com/blog/special-request/) released his official video for ["Let the Weed Bun"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONyrc0jHb3A), [](https://www.facebook.com/Skwig)**Skwig** just sent us this bootleg he made a while back, messing around with some accapellas and jungle beats !

He matched the classic 90s jungle Omni Trio & Foul Play track « Renegade Snares » with the herbal dancehall vibes of Taiwan Mc’s new release : « Let The Weed Bun » feat Davojah, and the result is weirdly addictive !

### *A word about Skwig :*

“Hailing from the Parisian bass music undergound, classically-trained musician and accomplished sound engineer, **Skwig** is what you may call a jack of all trades.

<br>

Within his solo project with releases on [Egregore Collective](https://egregorecollective.bandcamp.com/), Noizion Records and Le French Work, Skwig explores the many facets of bass music and the Hardcore Continuum, be it Dubstep, Grime, Footwork, Club Music or Jungle — styles that inspired his [“Kindred EP”](https://egregorecollective.bandcamp.com/album/egr005ep-skwig-kindred-ep) on Egregore as well as his first UK incursion: a contribution to Repertoire’s compilation [“Streelight Vol. 1”](https://repertoire.bandcamp.com/album/streetlight-vol-1).

Skwig is also found tweaking knobs within [Vernacular Orchestra](https://www.facebook.com/vernacularparis/), a live electronics act which has been smashing Parisian clubs since 2013 before evolving into Vernacular Records, a collective project and label pushing the envelope of modern Rave, Techno and Electro.

From behind a studio desk, a DJ setup or tweaking synth and sampler knobs, Skwig weaves a musical fabric which is only getting wider and more detailed as time passes by, and intends to perfect his craft for the rest of his life.
