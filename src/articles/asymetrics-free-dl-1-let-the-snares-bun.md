### Asymetrics Free Download #1 !

### Just as [Taiwan MC](https://theasymetrics.com/blog/special-request/) released a trippy music video for his song ["Let The Weed Bun"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONyrc0jHb3A), [](https://www.facebook.com/Skwig)**Skwig** sent us this bootleg he made a while back, messing around with some acapellas and jungle beats !

He matched the classic 90s jungle Omni Trio & Foul Play track « Renegade Snares VIP Mix » with the herbal dancehall vibes of Taiwan Mc’s new release : « Let The Weed Bun » feat Davojah, and the result is weirdly addictive !

You can download the track in .wav or mp3 below !

### *A word about Skwig :*

“Hailing from the Parisian bass music undergound, classically-trained musician, DJ, and accomplished sound engineer, **Skwig** is what you may call a jack of all trades.

Within his solo project with releases on [Egregore Collective](https://egregorecollective.bandcamp.com/), Noizion Records and Le French Work, Skwig explores the many facets of bass music and the Hardcore Continuum, be it Dubstep, Grime, Footwork, Club Music or Jungle — styles that inspired his [“Kindred EP”](https://egregorecollective.bandcamp.com/album/egr005ep-skwig-kindred-ep) on Egregore as well as his first UK incursion: a contribution to Repertoire’s compilation [“Streelight Vol. 1”](https://repertoire.bandcamp.com/album/streetlight-vol-1).

Skwig is also found tweaking knobs within [Vernacular Orchestra](https://www.facebook.com/vernacularparis/), a live electronics act which has been smashing Parisian clubs since 2013 before evolving into Vernacular Records, a collective project and label pushing the envelope of modern Rave, Techno and Electro.
