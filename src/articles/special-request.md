### [Out on 16 October](https://www.chinesemanrecords.com/shop-cmr/special-request-taiwan-mc/) , the French Reggae MC’s new output is a sheer treat to our ears.



Long time followers of the one they call ***Sticky Tai Tai*** are in for wicked surprises, and those just discovering for a total delight!

As you may have guessed by my hyperbolic words, I am part of the former and cannot stress enough how dazzled I am by the MC’s versatility on this new record…



After a promising first prowess on “[Cool & Deadly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHLsuVOaHNM&list=OLAK5uy_kGs07NCjwvn82of2ToZoqxJtFxWIVo5Ns)” (2016), and a number of killer releases ([Heavy this Year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDk530cdfM0&list=PLdqp8LBOB4VTd5WRWzaYgDhn1VxXGBbRN), [Diskodub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvxSvd9EQIU&list=OLAK5uy_ldMTS_HZo-Vfp0_evEJSsXH5YLmDxC6Fk), [Nah Leave me Corner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nx3EG2a8sZE), among [others](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1288550-Taiwan-MC)) which all showcased Taiwan’s unique touch and chemistry, ***Special Request*** ’s sound palette highlights an insatiable taste for sonic explorations: a big dose of **Reggae** with a splash of **Dancehall**, a dash of **Dub** of course, and a myriad of daring allusions to contemporary Hip-Hop, Funk, Reguetón, Dubstep & other global beats!

Surrounded by ultra-talented producers like [Jim Morrisound](https://www.instagram.com/jimmorrisound/) (on *Mr. Babylon*, with its [beautiful video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQrrzCB4xls), already chronicled in [THIS Asymetrics article](https://theasymetrics.com/taiwan-mc-mr-babylon/)), [Von D](https://soundcloud.com/vond), [Bony Fly](https://soundcloud.com/bony-fly), [the Asymetrics](https://www.facebook.com/asymetrics/) (yup!) among many, and backed by his partner in crime [S.O.A.P](https://www.mixcloud.com/Son_Of_A_Pitch/). for the arrangements & mixing, Taiwan MC also produced several of the album’s most memorable riddims. Did we already mention multi-talented?

***Hot Today- riddim by Taiwan MC***

<br>

The featurings are equally impressive: old-school Raggamuffin heads will be amazed with NYC legend and veteran [Jamalski](https://www.discogs.com/artist/29060-Jamalski)’s homage to Rub a Dub (***Life Ain’t Easy***), fans will recognize [Paloma Pradal](https://www.instagram.com/palomapradalmusic/)’s gorgeous lyrical style (*[Colombian Gyal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhNlIsk6-Wc)*), the funky touch of [Miscellanous](https://www.last.fm/music/Chill+Bump/+wiki) (***Boomshakalaka***) and connoisseurs of the French scene should dig the incursions by **Davojah** (***[Let the Weed Bun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5prlOK00EE)*)**, or [Dapatch](https://www.facebook.com/dapatch.selector) on ***Nah Leave Me Corner Pt2***. And speaking of that bomb of a tune, dubbed-out by the mighty **Von D**, this new cut features non-other than London’s own [Mr Williamz](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1334483-Mr-Williamz).

On several tracks, our man also demonstrates a clear love for Latin America, where he can count on a cult following since his hit ***[Catalina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7i-prhDw9A)*** (2016) dropped a bomb on dances from Buenos Aires to Mexico DC (and everywhere in between): for one of the album’s guaranteed hits, "***Fire"***, he called onto one of Colombia’s rising stars of Reguetón, [Landa Freak](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChHASctCm56ihzHEo4EosJA), for sheer dancefloor mayhem where Moombahton meets synth funk, orchestrated by the **Asymetrics’ very own Ben Masala** !

The already classic ***[Colombian Gyal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhNlIsk6-Wc)*** (with Paloma Pradal) is another sweat-inducing bomb shaking the Hispanic sphere, and ***Corazon de Madera*** is a future anthem that will surely touch the heart of many in the region!

The album closes with Taiwan’s wonderful classic ***One Last Dance***, composed by cutting-edge producer **[Samity](https://theasymetrics.com/samity's-wicked-playlists/)** and featuring [Anouk Aiata](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqNIR48CNrtn3yRbSbA9FjQ)’s beautiful hook. Vinyl diggers and collectors tip: this one was cut to [a limited series of 45’s](https://www.discogs.com/sell/release/14463913?ev=rb) last year!
