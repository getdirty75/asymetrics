[Listen / Download](https://soundcloud.com/nomagikmusic/edu-lobo-zum-zum-remix)

Boss of Bossa’s classic 1970 hit from the album [Cantiga de Longe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XOeueMas_c) gets finely and minimally remixed by [Akizzbeatzz](https://soundcloud.com/nomagikmusic) who gave it a recognizable funk swing with the ever-so sampled [Funky Drummer loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOCNmimkFTs).Don’t be fooled by Edu’s angelic voice, under that baby face hid a wicked trickster who dropped, on the same album, such psychedelic trips as [Aguaverde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=810dMXkk7ws) and **Zanzibar**:

Caution! Greek musical chemists [Sibu & Joe Nagall](https://soundcloud.com/sibu) deliver a heavy duty disco remix of Indian flagship artist[ Asha Bhosle’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asha_Bhosle) dancefloor killer [Udi Baba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGFrWNELHxo), from the 1982 movie[ Vidhaata](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084866/). If you’re not yet familiar with near-century famous Asha Bhosle, go check her hippie anthem Dum Maro Dum from the 1971 “Hare Rama Hare Krishna” film, a clip that will make you want to travel through time:

[Buy](https://www.discogs.com/Noor-Jehan-I-Am-Very-Sorry-Danka-Pyar-Waa/release/1740076) (Vinyl only) 

A special dancefloor killer that I have regularly pulled out of my 7” shoebox for a decade! A pillar of Pakistani music, who started in the 1930’s, legend [Noor Jehan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noor_Jehan) took an unexpected sidestep at the peak of [Lollywood](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/pakistan/articles/why-pakistans-lollywood-is-better-than-indias-bollywood/) and, [along with Kamal Ahmed](https://www.discogs.com/Kamal-Ahmed-Warrant/release/3601733), created a series of gems, including this one featured on [“Finders Keepers” 2009 repress](https://www.discogs.com/Noor-Jehan-I-Am-Very-Sorry-Danka-Pyar-Waa/release/1740076), a gorgeous tribute to this ass-shake-friendly bomb, composed for the movie “Warrant” (1975).Very Sorry is also on the label’s cutting edge [The Sound of Wonder](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFRUufS8uE5OR6kDehkCErxFWjXInpZhw) compilation.

This extract from the flick will give you a dazzling and rare insight into 70’s Pakistani movies, dimensions apart from today’s scene:

[Listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFtTcEP0r-8)

![](/img/theasymetrics_afrosound_ladanzadelosmirlos.jpg)

Classic Afro-Colombian psychedelic cumbia from the 70’s. Colombian maverick [Fruko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruko_y_sus_Tesos)’s pet project, [Afrosound](https://www.discogs.com/artist/743175-Afrosound) and their ghostly synths still resonate in Colombia close to 4 decades later, and are now sitting on top of many a crate-digger/ World music head’s playlists. Extracted from their 1973 album [La Danza de los Mirlos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hb0AALXl-8) issued by the mighty [Discos Fuentes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discos_Fuentes) label.

![](/img/erick-cosaque.jpg)

A totem of Guadeloupe’s music, [Cosaque](https://www.discogs.com/artist/1343000-Erick-Cosaque) had explored many of the island’s [unique music](https://guadeloupearc.com/music/) through his entire life, pushing Gwo-ka and pioneering Zouk. A recent compilation titled [Chinal Ka](https://antillesseries.bandcamp.com/album/chinal-ka-1973-1995) courtesy of Paris’ [Heavenly Sweetness](http://www.heavenly-sweetness.com/) did him posthumous justice – don’t miss this beautiful exploration through free-jazz infused traditional and emerging Antilles styles.

#### ***Cap’tain Creole: Fré Moin***

[Listen / Buy](https://captaincrole.bandcamp.com/track/fr-moin)

![](/img/captain-creole.jpg)

Exceptional one-offfrom an obscure Parisian 80’s reggae band originally named *Trenchtown Meditation*(full story [here](https://www.beaumonderecords.com/product/cap-tain-creole-fre-moin-ni-bel-jounin)). Legend has it that [this 2 track release](https://www.discogs.com/Captain-Creole-Ni-Bel-Jounin-/master/1521070) was their sole actual studio take, recorded on a whim in creole with a few friends, for the most intriguing result blending all the best that the mid-80’s had to offer!

<br>

<br>

<br>

#### ***Tita Duval: Batukacuto***

[Listen / Buy](https://vampisoul.bandcamp.com/track/batukacuto)

![](/img/tita-duval.jpg)

Extracted from a [1974 record](https://www.discogs.com/Tita-Duval-Y-El-Nuevo-Ritmo-De-Bobby-Rey-Cumbias-Internacionales/release/12509193) born to the Argentine power couple Tita Duval and Bobby Rey, who were based in Medellin at the time (oh oh!). This splendid tripped-out cumbia cut was recently re-released through Madrid-based [Vampisoul](https://vampisoul.bandcamp.com/album/cumbias-internacionales) – don’t miss their essential catalogue of beautiful music without borders.

#### ***Marlui Miranda: Tchori Tchori (with Uakti)***

[Listen / Buy](https://selvadiscos.bandcamp.com/album/tchori-tchori-brasingles-vol-1)

A researcher of indigenous music, [Marlui Miranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlui_Miranda) called on to [Philip Glass’](https://philipglass.com/) Brazilian protégés [Uakti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uakti_(band)) to illustrate a series of field recordings, eventually only self-released on CD in 1995. [Selvadiscos](https://selvadiscos.bandcamp.com/music) recently did us the favor of re-mastering and releasing this unique piece.

#### ***Karol Conka: Vogue do Gueto***

Blurring the lines between rap, electronica, kuduro and baile funk, hyperactive Brazilian singer [Karol Conka](https://karolconka.com/) drops a favela-infused tribute to the [Voguing](https://mixmag.net/feature/a-brief-history-of-voguing) movement.

#### ***Flamingo Pier: Boogie Meltdown***

Killer label [Soundway](https://soundwayrecords.com/) is responsible for this 2020 Kiwi boogie madness. Hailing from the [Flamingo Pier](https://www.flamingopier.net/), this one was just made for the [pop & lock](https://stayhipp.com/glossary/what-is-the-pop-and-lock/) massive!

#### ***Bill Campbell: Body Beat***

![](/img/bill-campbell.jpg)

From the brand new [Soca Dub and Electronic Calypso](https://soundwayrecords.bandcamp.com/album/body-beat-soca-dub-and-electronic-calypso-1979-98) print, this is a reminder of how rocking Calypso can be, even when taking obscure turns! It’s accessorily also yet another example of how insanely cool and versatile releases from Soundway are, one of this author’s hero labels, which you can be sure to hear more about in future round-ups.

#### ***The Mauskovic Dance Band: Space Drum Machine (Detroit Swindle’s flute mix)***

Some Dutch goodness, [courtesy of Soundway](https://soundwayrecords.com/release/179329-the-mauskovic-dance-band-space-drum-machine-detroit-swindles-flute-mix) (yup, again). This remix by Amsterdam-based (as their name indicates) [Detroit Swindle](https://detroitswindle.com/) is a disco UFO with a tropical twist just made to tweak your brain connections and make that booty shake.

#### ***Jovino Dos Santos: Bo Ta Cool***

![](/img/jovino.jpg)

Incredible surprise when listening to New York City’s [Ostinato Records](https://ostinatorecords.bandcamp.com/music)’ wonderful [compilation of Cape Verdean](https://ostinatorecords.bandcamp.com/album/synthesize-the-soul-astro-atlantic-hypnotica-from-the-cape-verde-islands) psychedelic synth funk, and early Funana: Jovino is somewhat of a childhood friend who once took me around the best islanders’ hangouts in Lisbon in the early 90s. I had never known he was a phenomenal musician in his youth!

The entire compilation is a perfect follow-up to [Analog Africa](https://analogafrica.bandcamp.com/)’s groundbreaking [Space Echo](https://analogafrica.bandcamp.com/album/space-echo-the-mystery-behind-the-cosmic-sound-of-cabo-verde-finally-revealed) album. Hot tip!
